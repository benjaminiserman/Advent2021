The collection of C# scripts I created to solve Advent of Code 2021.
I was trying to complete these problems as fast as possible, so many of them have better solutions provided that I wrote after the fact.

File Naming Conventions:

Each name is two digits separated by a hyphen (-).
The first digit is the day, the second digit is the part.

Optionally, a name has a second hyphen with a comment after it.
These represent alternate solutions to the same problem that I wrote after initially completing the problem.

For sorting reasons, days 10-19 are prefixed with 'a' and days 20-25 are prefixed with 'b'

For example: 5-2.cs represents my initial solution to Day 5 Part 2.
