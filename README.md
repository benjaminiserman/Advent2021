The collection of C# scripts I created to solve Advent of Code 2021.
I was trying to complete these problems as fast as possible, so many of them have better solutions provided that I wrote after the fact.

File Naming Conventions:

Each name is two numbers separated by a hyphen (-).
The first numbers is the day, the second numbers is the part.

Optionally, a name has a second hyphen with a comment after it.
These represent alternate solutions to the same problem that I wrote after initially completing the problem.

For example: 5-2.cs represents my initial solution to Day 5 Part 2.
