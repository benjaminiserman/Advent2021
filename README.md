# Advent2021

The collection of C# scripts I created to solve Advent of Code 2021.
I was trying to complete these problems as fast as possible, so many of them have better solutions provided that I wrote after the fact.

Each file is its own separate script. To run, try compiling a file on its own.

## File Naming Conventions

Each name is two numbers separated by a hyphen (-).
The first number is the day, the second number is the part.

Optionally, a name has a second hyphen with a comment after it.
These represent alternate solutions to the same problem that I wrote after initially completing the problem.

For example: 5-2.cs represents my initial solution to Day 5 Part 2.

## Usage

1. Download the file relating to the day and part you want to solve.
2. Create a new C#10 Console project in your IDE of choice.
3. Replace the main cs file of this new project with the file you downloaded.
4. Build the project and run.
5. Use CTRL+A, CTRL+C on your puzzle input, then paste it into the console.
